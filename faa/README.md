# FAA Dataset
The NTSB FAA Dataset includes information about flights, airports, carriers, and aircrafts. We are providing here a small subset of the full dataset (available in BigQuery) for the purpose of trying out Malloy.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: this dataset is a partial sample for demonstration only, and to properly analyze the data, the full dataset available in BigQuery should be used.
